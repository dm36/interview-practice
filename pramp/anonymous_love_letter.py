# Anonymous Love Letter
# You have written an anonymous love letter
# and you don’t want your handwriting to be recognized.
# Since you don’t have a printer within reach, you are trying
# to write this letter by copying and pasting characters from a
# newspaper.
#
# Given a string L representing the letter and a string N
# representing the newspaper, return true if the L can be
# written entirely from N and false otherwise.
# The letter includes only ascii characters.
