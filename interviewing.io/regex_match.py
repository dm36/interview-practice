#  Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.
#
# '.' Matches any single character.
# '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
# Input:
# s = "aa"
# p = "a"
# Output: false
# Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
#
# Input:
# s = "ab"
# p = ".*"
# Output: true
# Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
