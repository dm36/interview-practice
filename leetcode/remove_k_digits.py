# Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

# Note:
# The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
# The given num does not contain any leading zero.
# Example 1:

# Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
# Output: "1219"
# Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
# Example 2:

#     ignore this edge case - leading zero removal
# Input: num = "10200", k = 1
# Output: "200"
# Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
# Example 3:

#     ignore this edge case - let us work on main problem first
# Input: num = "10", k = 2
# Output: "0"
# Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.


# class Solution:
#     def removeKdigits(self, num: str, k: int) -> str:


# 3CN = O(n!)
# brute force solution- pick all combinations of 3 digits from the input
# remove each combination from the input and get the resulting number
# then take the minimum of all these numbers

# 1432219

# assign every digit its numerical value
# (looking at this in reverse)
# give it a priority

# 9 = 9
# 1 = 10
# 2 = 200
# 2 = 2000
# 3 = 30,000
# 4 = 400,000
# 1 = 1,000,000

# 1432219

# go through every digit- remove it and check what the minimum could be with
# the remaining digits- until we have removed k digits
# once k is 0- return that number that we have

# [1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 9]
# choose to remove the 1, min(removeKDigits(432219, k - 1)
# choose to remove the 4, min(removeKDigits(132219, k - 1))

# 1432219 as your input
# n is the number of digits in your number

# [1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 9]
# delete the 1, [4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 9]
# delete the 4, [1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 9]

# left with [4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 9]


# 1432219
# either you delete the 1 or not
# i is an index that is initialized to the number of digits in the input
# delete the 1 min(432219, k - 1, i + 1) or min(1432219, k, i)


# first case is if we choose to remove that digit
# slice it out, increment i, decrement k

# second case
# is if we chooose to keep that digit, nums stays the same
# i increments by 1 (we're moving over a digit, and k remains the same
# because we haven't removed a digit)
